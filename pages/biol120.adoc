These notes are mostly to fill in the stuff that's not covered
in the lecture slides.

== Lecture 2: Plant Cells

You can detect microtubule-related activity by adding a drug that
inhibits microtubule assembly and seeing if the thing still happens.

You can similarly use actin-inhibiting drubs to detect actin fillament
activity.

== Study Notes: First Midterm

What are the challenges faced by early land plants?

* Harvesting light energy
* Giving up the "sea of moderation"
* Staying moist
* Coping with gravity
* "Divide and conquer"
* Leveraging resources

Cell Theory

* Organisms are one or more cell
* Cells are the building block of life
* New cells come from old cells

. Planation (branches arrange into a plane)
. Syngenesis (webbing forms between branches)

| Sorus | Stalked sporangia form bundles on the underside
of fern leaves called sori.
| Indusium | A membrane that may protect a sorus
| Annulus | A ring of thick cells around a sorus

have archegonia and antheridia. Dies shortly after
sporophyte is born.

| Endosporic Development | When the gametophyte starts growing inside the spore.

| Integument | A membrane wrapping something. Surrounds megasporangium in
conifers, where it has a pore called a micropyle.

| Monoecious | Both types of sporangium present on the same plant.
| Diecious | Types of sporangium present different plants.

| Tracheid | Long cells in xylem that help transport water.

=== Bryophytes

* Mosses, liverworts, hornworts

* Has alternation of generations
* Came onto land bc of rising oxygen (became ozone) filtering out UV
* Needs water, but can hibernate without it
* Photosynthetic cells mixed with non-photosynthetic
* Mostly dead cells that hold 20x dry weight in water
* Antimicrobial. Similar to green algae. Approx. 1:1 diploid:haploid
* Can reproduce asexually by fragmentation

Similarities between bryophytes and green algae:

* Cellulosic walls
* Similar cell division
* Phytochrome pigment
* Chlorophyll a & b, carotenoids
* Thylakoid grana
* Hornworts have pyrenoids

Bryophyte similarities to vascular plants:

* Waxy cuticle
* Protected male & female reproductive structures
* Multicellular embryo protected in female parent
* Makes spores by meiosis
* Sporangia and Gametangia protected by sterile cell layer
* Stores food as starch
* Stomata & transpiration

Bryophyte differences from vascular plants:

* Thalli instead of leaves
* Rhizoids like roots, but only anchor
* Hydroids conduct water
* Occasionally Leptoids conduct food

Liverworts:

* Phylum Hepaticophyta
* Flattened, lobed thalli
* Spores germinate to make protonema (short filament gametophyte)
* Unicellular rhizoids. Archegonia hang down, antheridia protrude up
* Reproduce asexually with *gemmae* -- tiny lens-shaped pieces of tissue
that become detached from the thallus.
* Elaters develop in the sporophyte w/ spores

Hornworts:

* A pyrenoid in the chloroplast
* Fragmentation sometimes
* Hornlike sporophytes w/ meristem in base (foot)

Moss:

* Peat, rock and true mosses
* Bladelike unicellular leaves, not lobed
* Numerous chloroplasts per cell
* Big dead watery cells, small green photosynthetic cells
* Stemlike axis, no xylem of phloem
* Antheridia on short stalks, unicellular walls, diflagellar sperms
* Useful for:
** Soil amendment, remediation
** Fuel
** Clean wounds, make diapers

=== Seedless vascular plants

* Ferns and shit
* Big damn deal ~350mya
* Developed xylem and phloem
* Real leaves, roots
* Sporophyte is dominant

Psilotophypa -- Whisk Ferns

* Dichotomous branching stems
* No leaves or roots
* Enations
* Sporangia fused in 3s at tips of short branches
* Gametophytes develop from spores underground

Lycophyta -- Ground Pines, Spike Mosses, Quillworts

* Collectively called Club mosses
* Microphylls
* Lycopodium -- Ground Pine
** Leaves < 1cm
** Simple or branched stems, arising from rhizomes
** Sporangia in axils of sporophylls
** In some species, sporophylls have no chlorophyll,
are smaller, and are clustered into strobili
** Gametophytes sometimes look like small underground carrots,
sometimes are surface-level and green
* Selaginella -- Spike mosses
** Tropical
** Branch more than ground pines
** Leaves have a ligule
** Heterosporic
** Endosporic gametophyte development
** Megaspores become many-celled female gametophytes
** Microspores become basically just an antheridium--
male gametophyte
* Equisetophyta -- Horsetails and Scouring Rushes
** Branched & unbranched forms, < 1.3m tall
** Branches in whorls, scalelike leaves in whorls
** Stomata in grooves between ribs
** Hollow central stem cavity
** Silica on walls of stem epidermal cells
** Can be asexual by rhizome fragementation
** Strobili at tips of stems with sporangia
** Spores with 4 ribbon-like elaters
** Used for scouring and sharpening because of silica
* Polypoddiophyta
** 1cm to 25m, vary heavily
** Fern leaves are megaphylls called fronds
** Require water to reproduce
** Most successful SVPs
** No secondary growth
** Ornamental, edible rhizomes, fold medicine.
Fronds to thatch houses, weave baskets.

=== Gymnosperms

Oldest known seeds. Seeds have a protective coat,
supply of food, and can remain dormant in bad conditions.

Gymnosperms have exposed seeds (gymnos=naked) produced on
surface of sporophylls or strobuli, not in fruit.

Airborne pollen means no water needed. Also, we have secondary
growth of vascular tissue now.

Sporangia + megaphylls is thought to have led to seeds. Endosporic
development w/ the gametophyte growing inside the spore protects
the gametophyte.

All seed plants are heterosporous.

* Pinophyta -- Conifers
** Papery pollen cones make pollen w/ air sacs to add buoyancy
** Megaspores in the big woody cones
** Seed cones mature over two years
** No antheridium, sperm have no flagella
** Male and female cones develop on same plant (monoecius),
but at different locations
** Largest group of gymnosperms
** Largest and oldest individual plants
** Have tracheids, so they don't freeze like angiosperms
** Some don't make woody cones -- fleshy pseudo-fruits sometimes,
or fleshy cones
* Ginkgophyta -- Ginkgo
** Only one living species
** Dioecious
** Fleshy smelly seed coat, multiflagellate sperm
* Cycadophyta
** Slow growth
** Tall, do not branch
** Dioecious
* Gnetophyta
** Have vessels in xylem, which makes them unique among gymnosperms
** Shrubby "joint firs"
** "Double fertilization"
* Welwitschia
** Only one species
