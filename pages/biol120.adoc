These notes are mostly to fill in the stuff that's not covered
in the lecture slides.

== Lecture 2: Plant Cells

You can detect microtubule-related activity by adding a drug that
inhibits microtubule assembly and seeing if the thing still happens.

You can similarly use actin-inhibiting drubs to detect actin fillament
activity.

== Study Notes: First Midterm

What are the challenges faced by early land plants?

* Harvesting light energy
* Giving up the "sea of moderation"
* Staying moist
* Coping with gravity
* "Divide and conquer"
* Leveraging resources

Cell Theory

* Organisms are one or more cell
* Cells are the building block of life
* New cells come from old cells

.Things to know

| Chromoplasts | Pigment-storing plastids
| Chloroplasts | A type of chromoplast, larger than mitochondria,
two outer membranes, circular chromosome, full of thylakoids.

| Vacuoles | 90% of the volume of a plant. Sequester toxins, ions,
pigments, makes crystals, breaks down macromolecules and organelles.
Important.

| Tonoplast | Membrane around a vacoule

| Microtubules | stem:[alpha] and stem:[beta] tubulin. Big boys.
Move stuff. In flagella and cilia.

| Phragmoplast | Microtubule that constructs cell plate out of vesicles
| Microfilament | Actin chain to move stuff. Tiny.
| Intermediate Filament | Medium cytoskeleton fibre. Includes nuclear lamins.
Less well-researched.

| Plant cell wall | Made of cellulose microfibrils, 30% of a cell's dry weight.
*Primary* wall is just outside plasma membrane, *secondary* is between plasma
membrane and primary cell wall. Secondary is reinforced with lignin.
Also contains hemicelluloses, pectins, glycoproteins.

| Plasmodesmata | Tiny strands of cytoplasm connecting cells to form symplast.
Only certain sizes of molecule can pass through, but that can be altered
with viral "movement proteins."

| Lignin | A woody component that strengthens the cellulose in cell walls.
*Not in bryophytes.*

| Euglena | Algae; 1 long, 1 short flagella. Eye spot, pellicle,
3-membrane chloroplast. Sometimes has a gullet. Stores carbs
as *paramylon*, which is like starch.

| Pellicle | Plasma membrane with underlying spiral strips around the cell.

| Chromophyta | Also yellow-green algae. Mostly: freshwater, unicellular (some
colonial), two flagella in opposite directions, fragmentation & spores. Rare
sexual reproduction w/ oogonia and antheridia.

| Brown algae | Multicellular, heteromorphic generations, good fertilizer.
Makes *algin* (ice cream, latex paint, regulates water behaviour), iodine.

| Red aglae | Complex life cycles, agar (moistness, cosmetics)
 and carageenan, dulse and nori.

| Green algae | Stores starch in *pyrenoids* inside chloroplasts.
Unicellular, colonial, multicellular. Some terrestrial.
 
| Coleochaete a| A green algae, probably an indirect ancestor of land plants.
Shares:

* Parenchyma-like cells
* Cell plate
* Phragmoplasts
* A protective covering for zygotes
* Lignin-like compound

| Chara | Green algae, mineralized cell walls (stoneworts).
In addition to some of the Coleochaete stuff, shares
apical growth and lateral branches.

| Gametophyte | Haploid life stage.
| Sporophyte | Diploid life stage.

| Antheridium | Male gametangia
| Archegonium | Female gametangia

| Paraphyses | Unicellular strands among moss antheridia
| Calyptra | Top of archegonium flips off & froms this cap
of sporophyte in moss

| Homosporous | Producing only one type of spore. Most SVPs.
| Heterosporous | Two types of spore: mega- and microspores,
made by mega- and microsporangia, respectively. Some SVPs are like this.

| Enation | A small, leaflike, nonvascularized bump on a stem.

| Rhizome | An underground stem thing that gives rise to stems and roots.

| Microphyll | Like an enation, but vascularized.

| Sporophyll | Sporangium-bearing leaf
| Strobulus | A cluster of sporophylls

| Ligule | A lil leafy flap covering a joint

=== Bryophytes

* Mosses, liverworts, hornworts

* Has alternation of generations
* Came onto land bc of rising oxygen (became ozone) filtering out UV
* Needs water, but can hibernate without it
* Photosynthetic cells mixed with non-photosynthetic
* Mostly dead cells that hold 20x dry weight in water
* Antimicrobial. Similar to green algae. Approx. 1:1 diploid:haploid
* Can reproduce asexually by fragmentation

Similarities between bryophytes and green algae:

* Cellulosic walls
* Similar cell division
* Phytochrome pigment
* Chlorophyll a & b, carotenoids
* Thylakoid grana
* Hornworts have pyrenoids

Bryophyte similarities to vascular plants:

* Waxy cuticle
* Protected male & female reproductive structures
* Multicellular embryo protected in female parent
* Makes spores by meiosis
* Sporangia and Gametangia protected by sterile cell layer
* Stores food as starch
* Stomata & transpiration

Bryophyte differences from vascular plants:

* Thalli instead of leaves
* Rhizoids like roots, but only anchor
* Hydroids conduct water
* Occasionally Leptoids conduct food

Liverworts:

* Phylum Hepaticophyta
* Flattened, lobed thalli
* Spores germinate to make protonema (short filament gametophyte)
* Unicellular rhizoids. Archegonia hang down, antheridia protrude up
* Reproduce asexually with *gemmae* --- tiny lens-shaped pieces of tissue
that become detached from the thallus.
* Elaters develop in the sporophyte w/ spores

Hornworts:

* A pyrenoid in the chloroplast
* Fragmentation sometimes
* Hornlike sporophytes w/ meristem in base (foot)

Moss:

* Peat, rock and true mosses
* Bladelike unicellular leaves, not lobed
* Numerous chloroplasts per cell
* Big dead watery cells, small green photosynthetic cells
* Stemlike axis, no xylem of phloem
* Antheridia on short stalks, unicellular walls, diflagellar sperms
* Useful for:
** Soil amendment, remediation
** Fuel
** Clean wounds, make diapers

=== Seedless vascular plants

* Ferns and shit
* Big damn deal ~350mya
* Developed xylem and phloem
* Real leaves, roots
* Sporophyte is dominant

Psilotophypa -- Whisk Ferns

* Dichotomous branching stems
* No leaves or roots
* Enations
* Sporangia fused in 3s at tips of short branches
* Gametophytes develop from spores underground

Lycophyta -- Ground Pines, Spike Mosses, Quillworts

* Collectively called Club mosses
* Microphylls
* Lycopodium -- Ground Pine
** Leaves < 1cm
** Simple or branched stems, arising from rhizomes
** Sporangia in axils of sporophylls
** In some species, sporophylls have no chlorophyll,
are smaller, and are clustered into strobili
** Gametophytes sometimes look like small underground carrots,
sometimes are surface-level and green
* Selaginella -- Spike mosses
** Tropical
** Branch more than ground pines
** Leaves have a ligule
** Heterosporic
** Endosporic gametophyte development
** Megaspores become many-celled female gametophytes
** Microspores become basically just an antheridium--
male gametophyte
* Equisetophyta -- asdf
