These notes are mostly to fill in the stuff that's not covered
in the lecture slides.

== Lecture 2: Plant Cells

You can detect microtubule-related activity by adding a drug that
inhibits microtubule assembly and seeing if the thing still happens.

You can similarly use actin-inhibiting drubs to detect actin fillament
activity.

== Study Notes: First Midterm

What are the challenges faced by early land plants?

* Harvesting light energy
* Giving up the "sea of moderation"
* Staying moist
* Coping with gravity
* "Divide and conquer"
* Leveraging resources

Cell Theory

* Organisms are one or more cell
* Cells are the building block of life
* New cells come from old cells

** Leaves < 1cm
** Simple or branched stems, arising from rhizomes
** Sporangia in axils of sporophylls
** In some species, sporophylls have no chlorophyll,

** Gametophytes sometimes look like small underground carrots,
sometimes are surface-level and green
* Selaginella -- Spike mosses

=== Gymnosperms

Oldest known seeds. Seeds have a protective coat,
supply of food, and can remain dormant in bad conditions.

Gymnosperms have exposed seeds (gymnos=naked) produced on
surface of sporophylls or strobuli, not in fruit.

Airborne pollen means no water needed. Also, we have secondary
growth of vascular tissue now.

Sporangia + megaphylls is thought to have led to seeds. Endosporic
development w/ the gametophyte growing inside the spore protects
the gametophyte.

All seed plants are heterosporous.

* Pinophyta -- Conifers
** Papery pollen cones make pollen w/ air sacs to add buoyancy
** Megaspores in the big woody cones
** Seed cones mature over two years
** No antheridium, sperm have no flagella
** Male and female cones develop on same plant (monoecius),
but at different locations
** Largest group of gymnosperms
** Largest and oldest individual plants
** Have tracheids, so they don't freeze like angiosperms
** Some don't make woody cones -- fleshy pseudo-fruits sometimes,
or fleshy cones
* Ginkgophyta -- Ginkgo
** Only one living species
** Dioecious
** Fleshy smelly seed coat, multiflagellate sperm
* Cycadophyta

=== Angiosperms

Magnoliophyta

* Heterosporous
* Female gametophyte wrapped in sporophyte
and only a few cells large
* Male gametophyte is a pollen cell w/ 3 nuclei

Flowering plants

* Co-evolved with pollinators
* Cross-polination made them very adaptable
* Populations can be very spread-out
* Flowers evolved from leaves
** Leaves that make spores became sporophylls
** Sporophylls arange themselves into strobuli
** Sporophylls with microsporangia became stamens
*** The leaf part of a leaf with microsporangia shrank
into a filament, leaving the spores on top, enclosed
in an anther
** Sporophylls with megasporangia became carpels
*** A leaf with megasporangia folded over and sealed up
*** Separate carpels of primitive flowers with simple pistils
fused together to form compound pistils
** Leaves became sepals and petals

All flowers have at least one or more of the four types
of modified leaves (carpel, stamen, petal, sepal), and
all flowers have at least one type of sporophyll (carpel
or stamen).

** Radially symmetrical
** Stamens and pistils
** Superior ovary
* Specialized flowering plants
** Fewer, definite number of flower parts
** Bilateral symmetry

** Inferior ovary

Plant lifecycles and reproductive structures:

* Asexual reproduction is very successful in stable environments.
* Sexual is good at adapting to changing/new environments
* Bryophytes
** Produce one type of spore that makes separate male and
female gametophytes
** Sporophyte is dependent, gametophyte independent
* Ferns and SVPs
** Single type of spore makes a bisexual gametophyte
** Sporophyte and gametophyte independent
** Gametophyte much smaller
* Gym- and angiosperms
** Heterosporic
** Sporophyte independent, gametophyte microscopic and dependent

Gymnosperms

* Microsporocyte does meiosis
* Each microspore becomes a pollen grain with 4 cells
** Two prothallial cells that we don't know what they're for
** A generative cell -- divides and makes sterile cell and
spermatogenous cell, which makes 2 sperm cells
** A tube cell, which makes the pollen tube

. Pollen lands on drops of pollination fluid on ovulate scales
. Evaporation brings pollen through microphyle into contact
with the megasporangium, where it germinates
. This stimulates the development of the megasporocyte
. A month later, meiosis makes 4 megaspores
. Three degenerate and one survives and becomes the gametophyte,
which makes 2-5 archegonia with an egg each
. 15 months after pollinatiton, fertilization takes place
. Only one sperm fertilizes, the other degenerates
. Scales close after pollination

Angiosperms

. Anther makes microsporocytes
. Each one does meiosis, makes 4 microspores,
which each mitose into 2 cells (no prothallial cells)
. Megasporangia in ovary surrounded by one or two integuments
. Meiosis to make 4 megaspores; one survives
. It makes 3 nuclear divisions to make 8 haploid nuclei
.. Two move to the centre (central nuclei)
.. Three cells then form at each end of the sac
.. The cells closest to the micropyle (polar) make the egg and 2 synergids
.. The other group (andipodals) is useless??

* After pollination, further development of male gametophyte may not
take place unless the pollen is compatible (same species)
* Tube nucleus stays at tip of pollen tube; generative cell hangs back to split
* Pollen tuble enters female gametophyte, busts up synergid, blows load
* One sperm fertilizes the egg, the other unites with the polar nuclei
to make a triploid endosperm (double fertilization)
* Endosperm serves as food for the plant
* Sometimes endosperm is even >3n, like in lillies, which end up being 5n
