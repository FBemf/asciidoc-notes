These notes are mostly to fill in the stuff that's not covered
in the lecture slides.

== Lecture 2: Plant Cells

You can detect microtubule-related activity by adding a drug that
inhibits microtubule assembly and seeing if the thing still happens.

You can similarly use actin-inhibiting drubs to detect actin fillament
activity.

== Study Notes: First Midterm

What are the challenges faced by early land plants?

* Harvesting light energy
* Giving up the "sea of moderation"
* Staying moist
* Coping with gravity
* "Divide and conquer"
* Leveraging resources

Cell Theory

* Organisms are one or more cell
* Cells are the building block of life
* New cells come from old cells

=== Bryophytes

* Mosses, liverworts, hornworts

* Has alternation of generations
* Came onto land bc of rising oxygen (became ozone) filtering out UV
* Needs water, but can hibernate without it
* Photosynthetic cells mixed with non-photosynthetic
* Mostly dead cells that hold 20x dry weight in water
* Antimicrobial. Similar to green algae. Approx. 1:1 diploid:haploid
* Can reproduce asexually by fragmentation

Similarities between bryophytes and green algae:

* Cellulosic walls
* Similar cell division
* Phytochrome pigment
* Chlorophyll a & b, carotenoids
* Thylakoid grana
* Hornworts have pyrenoids

Bryophyte similarities to vascular plants:

* Waxy cuticle
* Protected male & female reproductive structures
* Multicellular embryo protected in female parent
* Makes spores by meiosis
* Sporangia and Gametangia protected by sterile cell layer
* Stores food as starch
* Stomata & transpiration

Bryophyte differences from vascular plants:

* Thalli instead of leaves
* Rhizoids like roots, but only anchor
* Hydroids conduct water
* Occasionally Leptoids conduct food

Liverworts:

* Phylum Hepaticophyta
* Flattened, lobed thalli
* Spores germinate to make protonema (short filament gametophyte)
* Unicellular rhizoids. Archegonia hang down, antheridia protrude up
* Reproduce asexually with *gemmae* -- tiny lens-shaped pieces of tissue
that become detached from the thallus.
* Elaters develop in the sporophyte w/ spores

Hornworts:

* A pyrenoid in the chloroplast
* Fragmentation sometimes
* Hornlike sporophytes w/ meristem in base (foot)

Moss:

* Peat, rock and true mosses
* Bladelike unicellular leaves, not lobed
* Numerous chloroplasts per cell
* Big dead watery cells, small green photosynthetic cells
* Stemlike axis, no xylem of phloem
* Antheridia on short stalks, unicellular walls, diflagellar sperms
* Useful for:
** Soil amendment, remediation
** Fuel
** Clean wounds, make diapers

=== Seedless vascular plants

* Ferns and shit
* Big damn deal ~350mya
* Developed xylem and phloem
* Real leaves, roots
* Sporophyte is dominant

Psilotophypa -- Whisk Ferns

* Dichotomous branching stems
* No leaves or roots
* Enations
* Sporangia fused in 3s at tips of short branches
* Gametophytes develop from spores underground

Lycophyta -- Ground Pines, Spike Mosses, Quillworts

* Collectively called Club mosses
* Microphylls
* Lycopodium -- Ground Pine
** Leaves < 1cm
** Simple or branched stems, arising from rhizomes
** Sporangia in axils of sporophylls
** In some species, sporophylls have no chlorophyll,
are smaller, and are clustered into strobili
** Gametophytes sometimes look like small underground carrots,
sometimes are surface-level and green
* Selaginella -- Spike mosses
** Tropical
** Branch more than ground pines
** Leaves have a ligule
** Heterosporic
** Endosporic gametophyte development
** Megaspores become many-celled female gametophytes
** Microspores become basically just an antheridium--
male gametophyte
* Equisetophyta -- Horsetails and Scouring Rushes
** Branched & unbranched forms, < 1.3m tall
** Branches in whorls, scalelike leaves in whorls
** Stomata in grooves between ribs
** Hollow central stem cavity
** Silica on walls of stem epidermal cells
** Can be asexual by rhizome fragementation
** Strobili at tips of stems with sporangia
** Spores with 4 ribbon-like elaters
** Used for scouring and sharpening because of silica
* Polypodiophyta
** 1cm to 25m, vary heavily
** Fern leaves are megaphylls called fronds
** Require water to reproduce
** Most successful SVPs
** No secondary growth
** Ornamental, edible rhizomes, fold medicine.
Fronds to thatch houses, weave baskets.

=== Gymnosperms

Oldest known seeds. Seeds have a protective coat,
supply of food, and can remain dormant in bad conditions.

Gymnosperms have exposed seeds (gymnos=naked) produced on
surface of sporophylls or strobili, not in fruit.

Airborne pollen means no water needed. Also, we have secondary
growth of vascular tissue now.

Sporangia + megaphylls is thought to have led to seeds. Endosporic
development w/ the gametophyte growing inside the spore protects
the gametophyte.

All seed plants are heterosporous.

* Pinophyta -- Conifers
** Papery pollen cones make pollen w/ air sacs to add buoyancy
** Megaspores in the big woody cones
** Seed cones mature over two years
** No antheridium, sperm have no flagella
** Male and female cones develop on same plant (monoecius),
but at different locations
** Largest group of gymnosperms
** Largest and oldest individual plants
** Have tracheids, so they don't freeze like angiosperms
** Some don't make woody cones -- fleshy pseudo-fruits sometimes,
or fleshy cones
* Ginkgophyta -- Ginkgo
** Only one living species
** Dioecious
** Fleshy smelly seed coat, multiflagellate sperm
* Cycadophyta
** Slow growth
** Tall, do not branch
** Dioecious
* Gnetophyta
** Have vessels in xylem, which makes them unique among gymnosperms
** Shrubby "joint firs"
** "Double fertilization" -- two sperms fertilize one egg
* Welwitschia
** Only one species
** SW African desert
** Drought-tolerant taproot
** Meristem at base of leaves
** Dioecious
** CAM photosynthesis

=== Angiosperms

Magnoliophyta

* Heterosporous
* Female gametophyte wrapped in sporophyte
and only a few cells large
* Male gametophyte is a pollen cell w/ 3 nuclei

Flowering plants

* Co-evolved with pollinators
* Cross-polination made them very adaptable
* Populations can be very spread-out
* Flowers evolved from leaves
** Leaves that make spores became sporophylls
** Sporophylls arange themselves into strobili
** Sporophylls with microsporangia became stamens
*** The leaf part of a leaf with microsporangia shrank
into a filament, leaving the spores on top, enclosed
in an anther
** Sporophylls with megasporangia became carpels
*** A leaf with megasporangia folded over and sealed up
*** Separate carpels of primitive flowers with simple pistils
fused together to form compound pistils
** Leaves became sepals and petals

All flowers have at least one or more of the four types
of modified leaves (carpel, stamen, petal, sepal), and
all flowers have at least one type of sporophyll (carpel
or stamen).

Notes on fruits & seeds

Fleshy fruits:

** Berries
*** True berries w/ thin soft skin like tomatoes, bananas, blueberries
*** Pepo: Pumpkins, cucumbers, etc. with the thick rind
*** Hesperidium: thick leathery oil skin. Citrus.
*** Pomes (apples, pears, friends). Not *really* fruit bc flesh is petals
* Aggregate fruits
** A single flower with many pistils becomes an aggregate fruit with many seeds
** Raspberries, blackberries, strawberries

Dry fruits:

* Dry seeds
** Dehiscent (split open to release seeds)
*** Grouped by the way they split
*** Capsules (like poppies, star anise) consist of at least two carpels
** Indehiscent (do not split)
*** Maple seeds, grains, sunflower seeds, acorns & nuts

Seeds can be distributed:

* By air, like poplar or maple seeds
* By water, if they float
* By animals, if they are eaten or if they adhere to the animal like burrs
