== May 7th: Intro

Introduction to the idea of truth tables.

But those are a pain! So we use boolean algebra instead.
Similar to predicate logic, but stem:[xx] instead of stem:[^^]
and stem:[*] instead of stem:[vv].
stem:[not] stays the same. That's about it.

We also use stem:[bar A] for the negation of stem:[A].
