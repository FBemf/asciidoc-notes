== May 7th: Intro

This course is about making compilers.
We start off bare hardware and build up to a C-like language.
Our hardware is a simulated MIPS machine.

=== Number Systems

In decimal, base 10 works like this: stem:[12345 = 1*10^4 + 2*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 5*10^0].

In binary, it's the same. stem:[10101 = 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0].

To covert a decimal number to binary, you find the largest power of two smaller than it, set that
digit of your new binary number to 1, subtract it from the original number, and repeat until you
reach zero.

How do we encode negative numbers in binary?

"Pick a bit, if it's 1, it's negative, if it's 0, it's positive." That's the intuitive solution,
*sign-magnitude* binary.
