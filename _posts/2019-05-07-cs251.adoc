== May 7th: Intro

Introduction to the idea of truth tables.

But those are a pain! So we use boolean algebra instead.
Similar to predicate logic, but stem:[xx] instead of stem:[^^]
and stem:[*] instead of stem:[vv].
stem:[not] stays the same. That's about it.

We also use stem:[bar A] for the negation of stem:[A].

Basically:

[options:"header"]
|===
|stem:[X] |stem:[Y] |stem:[Z] |stem:[F] |stem:[G] |stem:[bar G]

|0 |0 |0 |0 |1 |0

|0 |0 |1 |0 |1 |0

|0 |1 |0 |0 |1 |0

|0 |1 |1 |0 |1 |0

|1 |0 |0 |0 |1 |0

|1 |0 |1 |1 |1 |0

|1 |1 |0 |1 |1 |0

|1 |1 |1 |1 |0 |1

|===

Much easier to just represent this as stem:[F = X bar Y Z + X Y bar Z + X Y Z ]
-- the equation defining the truthiness of F.

You can also see X instead of 1 or 0 in a truth table.
This means that the value of that column doesn't affect
the outcome either way.

Using X, we can express a table much more concisely. For instance,

[options:"header"]
|===
|stem:[X] |stem:[Y] |stem:[Z] |stem:[F]

|X |X |1 |1

|X |X |0 |0
|===

is much more concise than it would otherwise be.
