:page-description: A repository for notes, taken in Asciidoc

Hey.
This is the repository where I host all my course notes.
It's http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/[`CC BY-SA 4.0`]
licenced, so feel free to rehost them or something
(noncomercially, with credit given).

I set it up because I wanted a better way to have my notes around.
Asciidoc struck me as a really neat markup
-- all the hygeine of Markdown, all the power of LaTeX.

I mean heck, with the power of Asciimath,
`prod _(i=x) \^(x^2) 3 phi i " and " V uu U sube oo` turns into:

[stem]
++++
prod _(i=x) ^(x^2) 3 phi x " and " V uu U sube oo
++++

[NOTE]

This is a note.

"And you even get syntax highlighting".split.each do | line |

And Jekyll seemed like a great way to host it.
It certainly helped that they have an
